## Work in Progress

This is a vue component for cropping images (yes, another one!). The code right now is fully functional and working, but I am figuring out vue-cli 3 settings for creating a nice bundle and publishing it with npm, as well as finishing some documentation. I should be able to sort it out within a week.
